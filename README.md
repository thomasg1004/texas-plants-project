# Texas Plant Project


## Description
Texas Plant Project (working name in progress) is a static web application that will present native species of plants per eco-region in Texas. The app will allow users to select an eco-region, and then select which type of plants to view (trees, bushes, flowers, and grass-cover). The app will list all of the species pertaining to the plant type along with information on how to raise and care for the plants. View our initial design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/83ZMMq4ScZRRF6vEQ2NBj8/The-Plant-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=dDONEcS1YqkIU2Aa-1).

This application uses Vite + React, HTML + CSS, and Javascript to handle backend functions.

If you are unfamiliar with using git to push/pull changes, [here](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is an interactive lesson for you. Thank you to [pcottle](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching) and contributors for creating and maintaining this tutorial.
